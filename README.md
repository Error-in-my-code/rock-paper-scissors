# rock-paper-scissors
A simple command-line rock paper scissors game

## How it works
This program uses the random class in c# to generate a random number between 0 and 2, compares it to your answer, and states the winner!

## How to use
I just started learning c#, and refuse to take a class, so im learning as I go, I have definitely not made this program the most user
friendly. Once prompted to input your guess, you need to type ```rock```, ```paper```, or ```scissors```, minding the case.
